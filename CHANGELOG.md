# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Live AI storyteller: connect any OpenAI-compatible service (cloud or a local server such as
  LM Studio or Ollama) in Settings; keys stay in the system credential store. Replies stream in
  as they are written, can be stopped, and a failed or interrupted reply keeps your action with
  Retry and Change action. Every request is recorded in the usage ledger with token counts and a
  cost estimate when rates are known. Free connection test and an explicit test message.
  Diagnostics adds the AI storyteller check (contacts the service only on the deep check).
- Library, Quick Start and reader: pick a starter world, scenario and character with arrow
  pickers, play turns with the built-in offline storyteller, quick save (Ctrl/Cmd+S), save and
  load (older saves continue as a new branch), branch from any reply, restart a chapter, start
  the next chapter, rename or hide routes, delete whole stories. Unsent text survives Escape and
  closing the reader. Keyboard-only end-to-end test on Linux CI.
- Saves and replay: deterministic state reducer, snapshot caches (every 20 events, hash-checked),
  manual/quick/rotating auto saves, read-only save view, resume-as-branch, edits validated
  against the effective state, offline story engine self-test (TIMELINE_REPLAY diagnostic).
- Timeline core: typed event payloads, ancestor traversal, compare-and-swap route heads,
  forks, restart chapter, next chapter, regenerate fork, edit earlier action, hide/rename routes.
- Story database: first migration (stories, event graph, routes, saves, snapshots,
  generation runs, provider profiles, usage ledger, rate cards, preferences), single-writer
  transactions, pre-upgrade backups, startup consistency checks, migration fixtures.
- Secure key storage through the OS credential store.
- Diagnostics: database, deep integrity check, usage ledger, key storage.
- Project scaffold: Tauri 2 desktop shell, React UI, typed commands, version footer,
  Diagnostics (app version, data folder), CI.
